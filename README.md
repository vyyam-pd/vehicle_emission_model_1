Predicting Vehicle Emission Data with Linear Regression Model

Project Description:
I created a linear regression model to predict vehicle emission data based on the car make, model, class, size, cylinders, transmission, fuel type, fuel consumption, and co2 emissions generated. Any NA values were filled with 0, and string variables were converted into binary. The model was first trained and tested with all experimental data, and then split into a 80, 20 training test split. This was done using python in google colab.
